Resistance

  The Resistance sanctuary that El had led them to was carved into a chain of natural caverns beneath the mountain range.  It was a little more entrenched than James was expecting to see, but on reflection, this particular installation had been around for at least a century and a half.  The paranoid in him had to admire the discipline that could keep a habitation as large as this one a secret for longer than he had been alive.  Flourescent lights lined the tunnel ceilings, the cavern walls were sanded smooth, and cement had been used to fill in inconvenient gaps in the walls and floor.
  El's brethren shared his childlike build.  Now that James and Chase knew that he wasn't human, they started to see the physiological differences in their companion: the proportions of his arms and legs were slightly off, his skin tone was just beyond the natural human range, and he blinked with an infrequency that made your eyes water once you noticed it.  Chase speculated that similarities in their overall body shape were either the product of convergent evolution or, more fantastically, a common ancestor.  El didn't know, but he responded to her question with the casual eloquence that she'd come to expect from him.  El was one of only a few of his race who were bald.  Most of the aliens they encountered throughout the halls and living spaces in the caves had sparse tufts of a hair or fur.  Violet was the most common eye color, although Chase noticed a few pale green and one light orange.
  Even after the initial shock wore off, living in close quarters with mind-reading aliens continued to give James lingering anxiety attacks.  Reassurances that it wasn't something that they did naturally, or without expending great effort, did nothing to calm his agitation, especially because they were wholly unsolicited.  Chase, on the other hand, was fascinated by their new allies.  As a hacker, the idea of browsing someone's consciousness struck a chord with her.  After all, it wasn't that much different from the way that she browsed hard drives.  She quickly became friends with the local engineering cabal and volunteered her hand at shoring up their digital defenses.
  They were given shares of power and provisions from the sanctuary's stores.  Power consumption and heat production had to be carefully regulated, lest they reach levels that Sphinx could sense through the rock.
  El acted as a guide, or a liason of sorts.  As far as they could tell, all of the aliens could speak English with the same easy fluency.  Language acquisition is a little easier when you can just lift it out of the subject's head and transfer it around wholesale.  El and his race had had centuries to do so.
  The tour around the caverns didn't take long.  Food here, weapons here, sleep here, and meetings in a wide amphitheater they'd rigged with A/V equipment.  James marvelled at the alien technology until he spotted the brand mark of a popular Asian manufacturer.  El didn't see the humor, but Chase was highly entertained.
  The apparent leader of the movement was a stern-faced wisp of an alien named Ka.  She gave her guests several days to acclimate before she met with them privately in her office.
  "Welcome to the resistance," Ka said somberly by way of a greeting.  "For centuries, we have waged war on representatives of your species.  It is always a pleasure to meet humans who aren't trying to kill and enslave us."  She extended a hand for a very human handshake.  "Please, have a seat."
  A low shelf had been carved from the rock wall.  James and Chase sat on it, cross-legged.
  "El tells me that you stole something from an Intech plant on Earth," she started.
  James opened the cavity on his arm and withdrew the chip.  The die was a short rectangle, only a few short centimeters to a side.  The wiring was too small for the human eye to perceive; a gold sheen permeated the green silicon, giving the chip an oily halo.  He held it up to the light, then handed it to the alien.
  Ka turned it over in her fingers, squinting.  "I have heard speculation this control chip could contain a storage unit that will finally give us a clue about the purpose of the Pandora project.  We've been intercepting comm chatter about Pandora for about twenty years now, but never with enough context to give us any clues about its nature.  You would think that it would be simple for us to learn human plans and motivations, but... over the years of conflict, your species has learned sophisticated protocols to prevent that very thing, and I'm afraid to say that they're most effective.  El may have mentioned shielding augmentations?  There has been much worry here that it's a new weapon, or a tool of subjugation for use against us.  That may be self-centered, but we need to consider the worst outcomes from our perspective, you understand."
  James nodded to indicate his comprehension.  Chase was staring at the chip as it spun in Ka's fingers.
  "Your engineers here are quite capable," Chase mentioned.  Ka bowed her head formally at the complement.  "Do you think that your team will be able to extract information from it?"
  "Time will tell, Chase.  But I would like them to make the attempt."
  Chase and James exchanged a look, then assented easily.  Ka nodded thanks.
  "One question," James said, half-raising his hand.  He briefly related the story of Alice's abduction, and the data center they had found holding files that documented many others.  "Do you know anything about these kidnappings?  Where they take the victims or what purpose it serves?"
  "No idea."  Ka blinked.  "The Mintaka IV colony is primarily a penal system, so I would expect that they were brought here... at least at first.  I do know that others of my species are quartered there as well.  El tells us that the slaves are used to perform extractions from other prisoners.  After that... some prisoners are executed, some are sent off again on outbound shuttles.  If there is a logic to it, we have not discovered it."
  "Do you keep records of the colony's activity?" James asked.  "Ships arriving and departing, communications, that sort of thing."
  Ka confirmed his speculation.  "Records department, second floor.  Any insights you could offer would be most welcome."
  With that, she thanked them for their time in a polite dismissal.  They exited the office.
  Chase brought the chip to the engineering team, who immediately started work probing its mysteries with an understated enthusiasm.  James spent the rest of the day pouring over records and transcripts for the past few weeks, plotting the ships that arrived from Earth on a timeline and listening to intercepted comm chatter captured in nearby intervals.  As Ka had said, operators were rigorously circumspect in word choice, and James found no meaningful slips in the transmissions he chose.  He did overhear several references to the Pandora levels of incoming prisoners.  Three of them were Pandora 7s; remembering the contents of the file that Chase had shown him, he marked those entries with a tentative "Possible?"

  The next day passed without incident or headway on either project.  The alien engineers were able to fabricate a makeshift interface module to the chip, and to produce a detailed map of the circuitry it contained.  When they projected the circuitry on the cavern wall, it covered the wall with grey ant-trails: they need to magnify a single small region hundreds of times to be able to examine it and leave notes on each subcircuit.  It was laborous going, but El's people had patience to match their longevity.  The engineering team worked late into the night.

  On the second day, a Watcher stationed at the penal colony issued a high alert.  A craft was arriving at the main landing pad, and by the hurried preparations at the pad, it was not expected to be a friendly one.
