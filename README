This is my 2010 entry for NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month).  See http://www.nanowrimo.org/ for details on the... competition?  challenge?  I'm pushing it here primarily as an offsite backup, and so that I can synchronize between machines as necessary.  Don't check it out expecting quality!  That's not the Nano spirit.

50000 words or bust!
