Incarceration

  James woke in prison.
  His cell was ten meters to a side, floor, ceiling, and three walls of featureless bare concrete.  He didn't even have a bed.  The other wall was a grid of iron bars as thick as his arm.  Dim illumination, off-white, spilled into the cube from the hallway outside.
  Across the hall, another set of bars hatched across another cell.  At first glance, James thought it was empty, but as his eyes adjusted he saw its occupant.  A small child, bald, of indeterminate gender sat cross-legged in the cell's center, regarding him with pale violet eyes.
  "You're awake," the child announced in a soft voice with a musical lilt.
  James rubbed sleep from his eyes.  His neck and his limbs felt unnaturally stiff.  "How long was I unconscious?"
  "Since you were brought here: fourteen hours, twenty five minutes, and thirty one seconds."
  He jumped to his feet as memories returned to him.  "Chase!"  The child gave no response.  He couldn't quite fit his head through the cell bars, and he couldn't see any other adjoining cells from any point in his cube.  Unsurprisingly, his net access was denied as well, feeding his optics just a stark login page.  Just as suddenly as it had taken him, the sudden burst of energy left him.  He sank back to the floor with a deep breath.
  "Who are you?" he asked his companion.
  "El," the child answered.
  "And what are you here for, El?" he asked, curiously.
  "I was a revolutionary."
  "A revolutionary?"
  "We resist the sovereignty of the Sphinx corporation."
  James opened his mouth, then closed it.
  "You were fortunate to conceal the Pandora microchip as you did," the child continued.  "The kill order on your head was replaced by a capture one at the last moment.  Because Intech was unable to confirm which of you and your companions held the chip, it is highly likely that they were captured as well, and not executed."
  "How do you know all of this?" James asked, incredulous.
  "I have certain affinities for augmented nervous systems, and have had ample time while the sedatives held you to scan your thoughts and memories.  I apologize if this is an invasion of your privacy.  It... gets boring in here."  El blinked, sheepishly.
  James had to laugh at the understatement.
  "I expect that you do not have much time left," El continued, sadly.  "Soon, our captors will endeavor to discover the location of the chip, and at that point you and your companions hold no more value."
  "Are they going to interrogate me?" James asked.
  "No.  As soon as your wits return, they will use one of us to extract the knowledge from you."  El's expression tightened.  "I am sorry."
  "How- how long do you think I have?"
  "Another few hours, I would expect.  Possibly more, depending on when your companions regain conciousness."
  Despair gripped James.  He sighed and sank to the floor, lying passive on the warm concrete.

  Elsewhere, Chase stirred in her cell.  She had an end unit.  From the bars at the front of her cage, she could see an endless row of bars on either side of a long hallway, stretching to a perspective point.
  Upon sitting up and stretching, she wasted barely a moment before she started to work with her net connection.  Her weapons, a vast array of tools used to gain access to systems that were intended to keep her out, could not be easily disarmed.  Patiently, she tried program after program, vulnerability after vulnerability and scan after scan, but the network here was as steadfastly guarded as Intech's.  Time after time, she was denied and dumped back at the unadorned login page.
  A thought stirred at the back of her memory.  Surely this network didn't share an authentication server with...

  Access granted.

  As hours passed, he sat and tried to put his fate out of mind.  He did a short calisthenics routine with restless energy, trying to work some of the lingering cramp from his muscles.  Otherwise, he mirrored El, sitting quietly on the cell floor and waiting for death.  El barely moved a muscle during the entire duration.  James wondered how he could stand it.
  A deep thock resounded through the cell block, echoed all around them.  James blinked and frowned.  El stood, stretched, and effortlessly lifted his cell door into the ceiling.
  "Hurry," said El, beckoning.
  Unbelieving, James lifted his door aloft, straining just a little against the weight of the heavy iron before the counterweights kicked in.  He stepped out of his cell.

  El strode purposefully through the corridor, passing cell block after cell block.  James followed, assuming that his diminuitive companion knew more about this facility than he did.
  The cells were arranged in a wide grid pattern, with corridors criss-crossing every ten cells.  El turned down one side passage, then another.  As he turned the third time, he stopped abruptly.  As James rounded the corner behind him, he saw why.
  A familiar face greeted him sternly.  Nine feet of one of the enhanced guards blocked their progress.  Both sides were just as surprised to see the other, but the guard recovered first.  He levelled his weapon at first James, then El.  The guard tightened his lips, gestured with the gun, then let out a gurgling noise.
  James and El watched as the guard curled around himself into a ball, choking for breath.  He struggled to lift his weapon inch by inch, finger twitching toward the trigger, but collapsed in a heap before he could pull it.  Chase stepped around from behind him and rushed forward to embrace James.
  James held her tight.  She poked the guard with her toe.  "His heart decided to stop beating," she explained.  "It's good to be root."
