Assassin

  Nigel's business card called him an urban ninja, but he hardly looked the part.  It's true that he was lean and tawny with a bit of a coiled-spring air, but his attire was altogether inappropriate.  In his slacks and turtleneck, he'd fit far better behind a desk than he would killing for hire in ancient Japan.  The katana he'd been given on completion of his training hung unused on the wall.  He couldn't even remember if the blade was sharpened.
  His quarters were spartan.  The day his deposit was credited, he had energetically knocked all of the suite's internal walls away and tore up the tacky carpet.  A bare hardwood floor stretched from wall to wall, largely unconcealed by furniture.  A modest mattress lay against the far wall.  One wall was a broad pane of transparent plastic.  From the twenty-seventh story vantage point, his view of the city was unparalleled, and the setting sun bathed the room a brilliant crimson.
  It did look a little like a dojo, Nigel supposed.  In reality, the apartment was sparsely furnished he had blown most of his budget for decorating on the floor.  Authentic hardwood was expensive as hell, and if you believed the sticker his was forty percent genuine tree.
  He sat cross-legged in the center of his luxurious space and thought about the job yesterday.  As a career assassin, he'd done an awful lot of killing.  Generally, the contracts he took were the maneuvers of corporate warfire or organized crime.  Some suit in company A would decide that another suit in company B (or, sometimes, another suit higher up in company A) was being too much a nuisance, obstructing his career's proper advancement, or what have you.  Then, he would pay Nigel's agent a hefty transfer of credits, Nigel would kill the mark, and everyone who wasn't on the mark's side would be happy.
  He'd been known to take Illuminati or Triad jobs before.  Typically, the society would designate some minor authority as a roadblock for one or another of their various schemes, and once again Nigel would facilitate.  It never seemed to do them much good, at least as far as Nigel could tell.  Possibly, running a secret society and manipulating events from behind the scenes was less effective when any given person on the street knew your name.
  Yesterday, though, had been strange.  As far as he could tell, the woman he'd been instructed to abduct-- not kill-- shouldn't have been on the radar for such things.  Not that it was his responsibility to research his contracts, of course, beyond the necessary to perform the job.  But he couldn't help but wonder at the logic, or lack of it.  It wouldn't be fair to say that it disturbed his conscience, but it certainly lingered in his mind.
  Nigel did have a preference for conducting business in person.  Some of his peers conducted business entirely through the Net: crack the ice, hack the mind, and stop the heart.  He prefered wetwork, as an opportunity to get out a little and see more of the world.  He felt little attachment to his admittedly very nice home space, and as much as possible kept himself free to move at a moment's notice.
  An soft alert sounded in Nigel's HUD.  Another day, another job.  Flipping into the Net, he scanned the details.  Today's work was more in line with his expectations.  The mark was a middle manager, name withheld, ident code provided.  A quick round of preliminary research indicated that he hardly had the income to afford the most rudimentary personal defense.  Nigel wondered whose coffee he'd messed up one too many days to warrant the death note.  Well, ours not to question why.
  He overlayed on his vision a map of the mark's recorded travel and habits, easily pulled from company records.  The man's life manifested as a hazy smoke trail four blocks away.  Wavering from home to work and back again, day after day, scheming his schemes.
  Nigel shrugged on a coat and loaded the dartgun in his wrist, a short-range but silent weapon that could ruin someone's day from a distance of a few paces.  A much more suitable weapon for the modern killer than a rusty piece of steel.  With a yawn, he exited his home and shifted into work mode.

  According to the profile he was working from, his target worked the night shift.  He should be leaving for the office in an hour or two.  That left plenty of time for Nigel to get into position.  He already knew the terrain well.  He made it his business to always know the terrain well.
  The suspended walkways slung across the street amplified the icy cold of the January air, freezing his fingers as he loped his way through the city.  Cars blew past him on magnetic railways, blasting his face with shock waves of wind.  He covered the distance to his chosen interception point in an easy few minutes.  In an empty alleyway just ahead of the target zone, he took to the wall, a section of corrugated wall providing him easy handholds.  A convenient drainpipe granted him access the rest of the way to the low roof.  Keeping low to the rooftop, he slunk along to the building's front, and crouched behind a bit of facade.  On this street, his target would be at the most isolated of his nightly route.  Nigel could still see the ghost of his typical path, aggregated from nights upon nights of tracking data.  Every night, the same path out, to within a meter; early every morning, a lighter shade passed the opposite side of the street.
  Nigel's target passed into view, right on schedule.  The poor man walked steadily, unwittingly following his own shadow to the step.  Nigel waiting until the man wandered oblivious below him, then heaved himself gingerly over the building's edge.  There was a moment's rush of air as he fell the two stories or so to the walkway below.  Long experience and practice left him with hardly a flutter of anxiety at the acrobatic feat.  He planted his feet as he landed.  The shock absorbers in his legs cushioned his impact without complaint or noise.
  He closed the last few meters to the man with an unhurried pace, loosening his sleeve.  The moment before a kill, the world held its breath, and even Nigel hesitated.  Then the moment was past.  Nigel fired the bolt with unerring accuracy.  His unwitting prey gave a start and a soft cry and spun on his heel to face his assailant, far too late.  Already dying from the bolt that pierced his lung, crimson staining his shirt and tie, the man lost his footing and toppled over the broad walkway's edge.  He vanished into the gloom below.
  Now it was time for Nigel to make his escape.  It would be a day or so before any police arrived to investigate, so he felt no rush.  The most important thing for him now was to be careful not to leave a trace of his exit, as he'd been careful to arrive undetected.  Lacking an easy way to reclimb the building front he'd leapt from, he chose to make his escape through an alleyway down the street.  His profile of the surveillance units in the area told him that he could safely exit that way and bypass the checkpoint at the next major cross street.  Descending a ramp to a walkway on the level below, he put his hands in his pockets and shivered as he marched unhurriedly back home, contract fulfilled.  Payment should be arriving in a day or so by secure transfer from whatever sorry grudge-holder had placed the death mark.  Maybe he could buy a couch.

  James and Chase rode the monorail for kilometers through the city, making small talk and generally passing the time.  It was late afternoon.  James had made arrangements to leave work early, and Chase had woken up before noon to attend to her remaining responsibilities for the night to clear some time.  The monorail car passed under and over the brightly lit, endless citiscape.  The closest buildings blurred by in a rush of metal and plastic.  In the distance, lonely skyscrapers reached for the crisp blue winter sky, the afternoon sun reflected in each pane of glass.
  Smog and weather permitting, Rainier's lonely peak was visible for miles up and down the coastline and well into the continent.  As the journey progressed, James expected it to grow on the north horizon, but as far as he could tell it was part of the skybox, rendered at infinite distance.  After several hours of travel had passed, James and Chase disembarked at a sad and desolate station.
  The Rainier monorail station was a rectangle of plastic, as many like it, but this one looked ill-used in recent times.  Pieces of trash blew past on gusts of breeze and a morose calm had hold of the neighborhood.  A few steps descended to the dirt street, lined with boarded-up houses.  The mountain loomed overhead, an omnipresent silent watcher.  The street showed no signs of life.  Even the graffiti on the walls was fading.
  Frozen dirt crunched under their shoes as they marched toward the mountain.  Somehow, the place demanded quiet, keeping a strange hold on their minds and tongues.  A breeze whistled through the shoddy, corrigated rooftops of the houses.
  As they walked, Chase thought soberly about their task.  What had seemed the night before to be a fun jaunt into the countryside chasing phantoms seemed suddenly different.  The empty town was stark and unnerving in its stillness.  Walking here, the thought that they had been lured out to be killed seemed more and more real to her.  She looked apprehensively from side to side.
  After a while, James led the way down a nondescript side street.  Another block or so passed, and then, abruptly, they were at the city's edge.  The houses and buildings stopped in a ragged edge.  Across a gap of a hundred meters of low frosted scrub, the evergreen trees rose in a foreboding row.  The sun was just starting to set, setting the western sky alight.
  "Well, here we are," interjected James suddenly, an easy smile on his face.  For him, the thrill of discovery at least temporarily overshadowed his hesitation.  The note of enjoyment in his voice gave Chase a boost of encouragement.  "Wish we'd brought a picnic!"
  "We're here for Alice, remember?" she reminded him.  For the moment, the oppressive silence's spell had been broken.  "A hundred meters through these trees should bring us to the old hiking trail."  Nodding recollection, James stepped foreward and confidently closed the distance to the trees.
  Neither of them had ever spent time in a forest before.  The closest urban experience either had had was in one of the larger parks along the Pacific coast, where carefully cultivated trees and other regional flora were being showcased.  Here, in the wild, the tree trunks grew together unpredicably and haphazardly, without the need to leave space for humans to pass.  Chase carefully picked her way across a snarl of root matter.  Fortunately, the same augmentations that made navigating unlit and treacherous urban environments safer also helped in this one.  With a blink, she enabled night vision and safe footholds were plotted through the darkness.
  The last vestige of sun disappeared, the little light it had shed through the canopy taken with it.  Darkness claimed the forest.  Without their mapping equipment, James and Chase would have passed the trail in the darkness with little notice.  Instead, a faint outline illuminated the ground to their eyes.  James nodded in satisfaction.
  "Great.  We follow this trail about ten kilometers uphill, and our coordinates should be in the basin of a glacial valley to the east, if these maps are up to date, right?"  Chase murmured affirmatively, casting her gaze around the forest gloom.  Faint outlines of tree trunks and low-hanging boughs of evergreen were illuminated to her view.  With the breeze quiet, all was still.
  Following the ancient hiking trail through the forest proved to be more of a challenge than either had anticipated.  Trails require active maintenance to clear fallen trees or other obstructions after any decent storm and to stall the encroachment of the forest's undergrowth.  On paper, these paths were the responsibility of a nearby company; but the sheer number of trails throughout the park was too overwhelming a job for any one organization to tackle.  If they were even still in business, they had stayed that way by virtue of selective negligence.
  James gingerly picked his way over the tangle, steadying himself on branches and rocks by the trailside as he walked.  Occasionally, he called back a caution to Chase, softly, bringing her attention to a tricky foothold or jagged brush.  Meanwhile, Chase fiddled with the settings on her optics filters in a continuous balancing act between seeing the trail map and seeing the terrain.
  As they walked, the trail turned steeply uphill, following the crest of a low foothill.  The trees were thinning here.  The bright moon, almost full, shed a startling bright light through the more frequent breaks in the canopy.  Still, there was little sound but the crunching of dead leaves underfoot.
  Suddenly, the dark trees around them gave way, the trail turned sharply to the left, and they found themselves walking along what looked to be an old stream bed.  A corridor of bare rocks, rounded and pebble-smooth, cut a sharp swath through the otherwise dense forest.  In the past, a mighty river must have flown sped this course, but today only a small trickle babbled its way down the hillside.
  They made much better time crossing the rocky path than they had the denseness of the forest.  Here, the moon clearly illuminated the mountain overhead.  Now that they were hiking at its very roots, it dominated the sky as James had expected it to from the monorail.  To his awe, the peak still looked impossibly far away.  Below them, the stream bed cut its way into a misty darkness; at the horizon, they could now see a comforting glow above the treetops.
  After a kilometer or so in the stream bed, the trail jerked across the clearing.  It spanned the tiny stream with a footbridge of rotted wood, which surprisingly still provided adequate support for James and Chase, although the warning creaks it sounded as James crossed encouraged them to do so one at a time.  As they reached the other side, James was surprised to see that through a sparse layer of trees, a sheer cliff face rose; in the darkness it had been an amorphous mass near-indistinguishable from the night sky above it.
  "Almost there," whispered Chase behind him.  "At the top of this ridge we should be able to see for miles."
  Concealed in the cliff's face was a winding escarpment which the trail followed.  The grade was steep enough to wind James as they marched, enhanced legs nonwithstanding.  His breath manifested as puffs of moonlit condensation as the actuators in his hips struggled to absorb the work.
  Before long they reached the cliff's top.  The trail leveled and, for once, was clearly visible to the unaided eye.  On the plateau's top, sparse trees dotted what would have in the summer been a lush wildflower meadow.  A small lake was topped with frosted glass, a dark mirror reflecting the clear sky.  Chase smiled, pecked a quick kiss on James' cheek, and recorded a handful of snapshots.  She'd almost forgotten what drew them to this forgotten realm.  Lost in the moment, she was starting to think of this expedition as a particularly exotic date.
  They crested the gentle curve of the plateau's top following broad steps delineated with smooth logs.  Here they left the trail, which bent to the left again and followed the plateau closer to the mountain, to approach the plateau's other face and see into the valley below.  From here, Chase could already see their destination, marked to her eyes as a golden diamond ahead and through the ground at her feet.  As they approached the face James waved Chase to the ground and gestured for quiet.
  [Careful.  Voices would carry the length of the valley from up here.] he silently messaged her.  She acknowledged in kind, and together they crawled the last few meters to the edge and peered over.
  The valley stretched before them into the distance.  Evergreen forest and meadow topped a gently sloping hillside far below.  In the moonlight, they could just see a twisting ribbon of single-lane road winding its way across the valley's floor, disappearing into the forest to the south.  Nestled in the valley's center was a small cluster of centuries-old wooden buildings, connected by to the roadway by a set of flat parking lots.  Chase's golden diamond that marked their destination was overlayed on the largest building.  A small readout marked it as a thousand or so meters distant.
  [I don't see any motion,] Chase wrote after a few minutes of waiting and scanning.  [Nothing human in the infrared scans, either.]
  [Shall we investigate?] James replied, curiosity driving his impatience.  [I think there's a way down over there,] he gestured.
  [I suppose so,] she conceded.  James led the way to the break in the cliff wall that he'd spotted.  Although not as cleanly marked as the trail they'd followed up, the cliff on this side was much less sheer.  Rocky protrusions and breaks gave them ample opportunity to make their way down, albiet more slowly.  The path that James had spotted was actually stone worn bare by proximity to a small stream that tumbled over the cliff in a waterfall.  Now that they were close to it, the rush of water and the spray of frosty mist filled their ears and eyes.
  From the cliff's base, it was only a few minutes' walk to the buildings.  As they walked, James wondered what they might discover inside.  It was too much to hope to find Alice herself, trussed up in a corner, as though she'd been kidnapped by a cartoon villian.  Somebody had clearly wanted them to find something here, though, and had gone to the length of planting a physical note on him, presumably so that it couldn't be traced.
  A faded sign proclaimed "Paradise" optimistically over the building's door.  The tall structure must have been a hotel in centuries past, or possibly lodging for the mining industry that had done business here ages ago.  Although the buildings had been relatively well-preserved until a comparatively short time ago, time and weather were beginning to take their toll.  In places, the logs that formed its walls were cracked and broken, letting in the night chill.  As they stepped inside, they saw broken glass from a shattered window strewn across the floor.
  Chase walked through the threshold.  "The marker is--" she began.  She was interrupted by a jump of fright as she caught sight of a sudden motion from the shadows.  A black-and-white tabby cat wandered from its hiding place in a pile of fallen lumber and approached them fearlessly.  "Oh you scared me witless," she told the cat, heart racing.  James chuckled and held his hand out for the cat to sniff.
  "Well, we certainly weren't expecting you," he told it, "but I'm sure you're just here to get in out of the cold.  You were saying?"
  "Oh, the marker is still below us.  There must be a basement."
  The cat shied away from him and retreated.  James looked around the room and wandered to a doorway in the back, picking his way over the glass with care.
  They found the stairway down in what looked like it had been the kitchen.  The door here was missing altogether from its hinges.  Chase stopped abruptly and gestured for quiet.  "Hear that?"
  James obediently stood silent and tried to quiet his breath.  After a moment, he heard the noise she had noticed: a faint hum.  "Power?"
  With a slow nod, Chase peered tentatively down the stairway.  The moonlight couldn't penetrate here, but she thought her enhanced vision could detect a faint glow from below.  Watching her foot placement carefully, she descended and led the way below.
  At the foot of the staircase, another empty doorway opened to the right.  Chase rounded the corner, stopped, and gave a low whistle.
  She found herself at the entrance to a long, low room.  All along the walls into the distance, tall racks of blinking lights outlined rows of computers.  Tall, sturdy wooden pillars provided support at regular grid points through the room.  Attached to one pillar at the room's center was an old-style monitor, screensaver emitting waves of faint, shifting light.
  James examined the server racks with admiration.  "These are recent models," he observed, surprised.  He peered more closely at a manufacturer's mark.  "Very recent models."  He placed a finger on the rack that held them in place.  "And IR-shielded, too."
  Chase was only partially listening.  She had already crossed to the terminal and tapped the keyboard.  To her surprise, no password prompt appeared to challenge her.  The screen displayed only a single character in green text, and a flashing cursor, but it was enough to stun her.

#

  "This is a root prompt," she said, blinking in disbelief.  She wouldn't even need to crack her way in.  Somehow, the entire data farm had been just handed to her on a golden platter.

  The room had been configured with its only access as the single terminal; as far as Chase could discern, there was no place for her to make a direct connection, so she was going to have to do this the old-fashioned way.  Although she'd spent a certain amount of time in her youth hacking older systems, touch typing was not her strong point.  At least she did know her way around a command line.  With a few purposeful keystrokes, she fired off a few searches, and started to do some exploratory directory listings.
  The files were obtusely named and meticulously indexed by some algorithm that she couldn't quite divine.  Opening a few at random, they seemed to be case files of some sort.  Most contained only short and innocuous snippets of cryptic text.  Some contained ident codes and some contained names, so she assumed that each file was a person, but she couldn't find any clear description of why they were listed here.
  A soft bell drew her attention to another virtual terminal.  One of her locate queries and found a document.  She fired up a text editor to view its contents.

LISTER, ALICE : PANDORA 7
91F5A260-E9B9-11DF-9492-0800200C9A66
ACQUIRED ngl LOG 28530107-182437
PROCESSED tbl

  She was easily able to find the referenced log file.
  "Paydirt," she announced, paging through.  "This has everything about Alice's abduction, indexed and timestamped.  Page after page of..." she flipped forward.  "Every piece of software used, records of Alice's GPS..."  Her voice trailing off, she started to rapidly flash text past the screen, faster than James could read.  He realized that she was doing the sensible thing, in the absense of a direct link: she had enabled optic recording and was simply scanning the log into her memory by eye.
  James watched over her shoulder intently for a while, hoping to make sense of something in the file, but it was flashing past far too quickly for him to easily read.  His adrenaline started to subside a little and boredom began to creep in.
  After a few minutes passed, a plaintive miaow drew his attention from the stairwell.  The tabby hopped in the doorway and crossed to where he was sitting.
  "Well aren't you friendly," he told it.  "I bet you're hungry."  Another miaow, this time with a touch of impatience.  The cat started to rub against his hand, purring with just a hint of urgency.  "We didn't bring any food," he said apologetically.  "I guess there might still be something upstairs?"
  Without much hope, he ascended the staircase again and glanced around the kitchen.  The cat enthusiastically bounded ahead, stopping at an ancient refridgerator.  Its power had long since given out, but to James' surprise, when he opened its door he found a small stack of tuna cans in a back corner.  He grabbed one and gingerly cracked it open with a shard of broken glass.  The cat stuck itself head-first into the can, devouring its contents hungrily with a noisy purr.  Within seconds there was no trace of fish remaining, and the cat resumed its rubbing routine.
  "Oh all right," he said with a laugh.  Grabbing the rest of the cans, he started to crack them open one at a time.  The happy cat wandered from can to can.
  Just as he was considering checking on Chase, he heard a sound that almost stopped his heart.  He paced quickly over to one of the empty window frames.  Just as he'd feared: a short caravan of hovertrucks was rounding the corner at the base of the valley.  [Chase!  Incoming!]
  Chase, having finished a scan of the logs, was in the midst of conducting a leisurely scan of the system for other interesting things.  The first interesting thing that she discovered was revealed when she thought to check for the name of the system she was on:

# hostname
pandora01.intech.net

  Pandora again -- and now she had a name to tie to ownership of the datacenter.  Unfortunately, her search for files referring to herself or James never returned.  Considering the sheer storage capacity available within these walls, it was a fluke that she'd found Alice's file.
  When James' warning blinked across her vision, she hastily and mostly out of habit fired one last command:

# useradd -p test test

  Should she ever chance to have physical access to this system again, she would have an account.  If a legitimate and particularly vigilant administrator happened to notice the account, it would be safely disguised as an innocuous mistake.
  No time to clean the system logs, unfortunately.  Hesitating just a second, she exited the command shell.  The screen shuddered back to an ordinary login screen.  She tapped a key and the screensaver resumed its dancing-lights display.  James was waiting for her at the top of the stairs, watching for headlights over his shoulder.
  [We only have a few minutes before they get here,] he messaged silently.  [Any ideas?]
  Chase cast her gaze around the delapidated building for a hiding place, preferably one that wouldn't pin them without an escape route.  Her eye settled on the cat for a moment, who was watching them from a crack in the damaged back door.  It turned and wiggled its way through the narrow opening, vanishing in the darkness.  After a pause, she saw its eyes reflected back at them through the crack.
  [Follow the cat,] she announced spontaneously.  James gave her a look.  [I bet it has a hiding place around here somewhere that it uses when the people arrive.]
  [Well, I guess I don't have any better ideas...]  It took a combined effort to dislodge the remnants of the back door enough to swing open.  They squeezed through one at a time.  James flipped his vision to infrared and, to his surprise, the cat was still watching them from a distance of a few meters.  Once it was satisfied that they were through, it turned and loped off into the night.
  Fortunately for James and Chase, the bulk of the building obstructed their escape path from view of the approaching trucks.  Conical beams of headlights pierced the rotting wood, illuminating the ground around them and the trees in front of them.  Shadows scattered on the ground before them as they ran.  If the occupants discovered evidence of their trespass, they would only have a short time to conceal their heat signatures before a routine IR scan would reveal their locations anywhere in the valley.  Sadly, just hiding behind a tree wouldn't do.
  The cat trod with an impatient pace, picking a hidden path through the sparse trees.  After a few seconds, it descended into a narrow trench to one side and abruptly vanished from view, infrared and otherwise.  When they rounded the corner, they saw the shelter it had led them to.  An entrance to an ancient mine stood before them, half-concealed in the ground.
  The pitch blackness within the mine would have been much more intimidating to people who couldn't see in high-contrast and infrared.  James and Chase ducked inside without a moment's hesitation, and not a moment to lose: just as they disappeared into the opening, a floodlight swept across the valley outside.
  They followed the cat, an animated blur of deep crimson heat, deeper and deeper into the ice-cold mine.  A pair of iron tracks descended into the mountside beside them, although almost all of the railway ties had long since broken and rotted away.  Soon, they came to a switching point, the tracks and the rough-hewn cavern diverging in two directions.  The cat took the rightmost path.  After moment of trepidation, the pair followed.
  Just as Chase began to fear getting lost underground as much as getting caught, she saw clear sky ahead of her and blinked in disbelief.  She stopped suddenly.  James, following close behind, tripped and smacked into her.  "Sorry," she said once both had righted themselves.
  "Wait," said James.  "Where's the cat?"
  They both gave the walls and the tunnel a scan, but to no avail.  The cat had vanished into some nook too small for them, and walls of cold rock prevented them from seeing its path.
  "Well, that was strange," James announced.  "An unusual amount of intelligence for a cat, certainly."
  "I'd say that's about the least strange thing that's happened tonight," Chase replied.  James shrugged.
  As they ascended to the tunnel exit, Chase related the fruits of her labor.  "We've got some solid leads now.  You have a company to research, and I have a few gigs of text to make sense of," she concluded.
  "After," James corrected, "we get a shower."
  They stepped out into the fresh air.  With a clear line to the sky, James' GPS readjusted itself.  He pulled up a basic map.  "We're in the next valley over," he announced.  "It looks like we have about a two hour hike to the nearest monorail."  He reoriented himself.  "That way."
