Codex

  James, Chase, Raziel and El spent the next several days preparing for the trip to the Rigel system.  El estimated that the shuttlecraft would arrive in four days, which gave them some time to breathe before their next trial, but still, none of them felt particularly eager to depart.
  Bac and the rest of the base personnel kept vigilance high for the next days.  As Bac had stated, there was a high risk that the shuttle could lead unwelcome attention to the southern continent.  Both the outposts along the southern region and those stationed near the primary Sphynx installations continued to report that no Sphynx attention was headed in their direction.  Com chatter among Sphynx sources never mentioned the battle at all, a detail that worried Bac considerably.  In any case, despite his reluctance to support their venture, Bac offered to supply them with provisions for the trip, and admonished them to return the shuttle to Resistance control.  He only tried to talk El out of joining them once, but he was clearly well enough acquainted with El to realize that it was a futile gesture.
  Raziel possessed no maps or other helpful artifacts from his employment on Rigel's moon.  Much like the cleanup work that had been done to Alice's friends and co-workers, his memory had been purged of all recollection of any procedures or passcodes related to the Codex when his contract had expired.  James had assumed that the lack of a non-disclosure clause had been an oversight, but apparently Siren had merely taken a much more direct approach to the problem of information leaks.
  They had borrowed one of the base's small meeting rooms for preparation work.  Raziel projected the information he still knew point by point onto a shared hologram, while James and Chase asked for clarifications or details.
  "The Codex moon is barren and atmosphereless, much like Earth's."  He summoned an image into the projection: a gray sphere pocked with crater impacts rotated lazily in the projection's focus.  "Approaching it directly would be highly unwise.  Our ship has no stealth or camouflage capabilities.  In fact, its disabled IFF and location beacon is a magnet for armed response, as you witnessed firsthand.  The Codex installation itself resides half above the surface," a network of glass domes and tunnelways spread across one of the sphere's hemispheres, "and half below ground.  I expect that the room containing our objective is in this area."  He pointed, and a red cube manifested within the moon's heart, flashing.
  "You recommend landing on the world below, and getting to the moon from the surface somehow?" Chase asked.
  "That would be my preference."  Raziel panned the view out, shrinking the moon to reveal a much larger translucent sphere of blue and green beside it.  "Rigel III is a lush world.  Most of its surface area is covered by swamp or rainforest.  In addition to a small lowlands Siren presence, Lion, the research and development company, operates a sizable base there.  I believe that Pegasus also owns a number of mines.  Rigel III's crust is particularly rich in materials that can be used in the refinement of starship fuel.  So it's far from unsettled.  However, as far as I know, all of the settlement on Rigel is on its largest landmass in the northern hemisphere.  The south-eastern island arpeggio barely has enough solid ground to build on.  If we time our approach carefully, we might be able to land the shuttle while the bulk of the planet shields us from the moon, and gain the surface undetected."
  "How do we make it to the Siren base, then?" James asked.
  "I could arrange to borrow four hoverbikes," El offered suddenly.  "We stole them from Sphynx during heavier fighting years ago.  Some of our more isolated bases here on Mintaka use them for long-distance travel from time to time.  It's been a long time since it's been safe to use them here, though.  Jungle and ocean won't bother them, and we should be able to make it to the northern continent in half of a day or so."
  Raziel indicated thanks.  "That will do nicely," he said.  "They'll make the shuttle bay cramped for us, but they should fit.  The other settlements regularly sell supplies to Siren.  It may be possible for us to take advantage of one to get into orbit from there.  Beyond that, as I've said, we'll need to improvise."
  James smiled grimly.

  James was helping Raziel haul the bikes into the shuttle's primary storage when he finally asked for more details about Raziel's history with Alice.  The wind had died down somewhat from their arrival, making the chore less dangerous, but storm clouds still boiled overhead.
  "I met her at a conference," Raziel said.  "It was only a few years ago.  I was assigned to protect one of the speakers, whose name I do happen to be under contract not to divulge.  We went on a few dates together.  My livelihood is... not an ideal one, to support a relationship.  We tried to stay in touch, but I haven't really heard from her since."
  "Is that why you sought me out?" James asked.
  "No," Raziel replied.  "I was given your contract just like any other.  It mentioned only your name and your ident, nothing about who was after you or why.  I didn't hear about Alice until you and Chase told me."
  "Why didn't you mention this earlier?"
  Raziel paused, as they hefted the bulk of a bike up the ramp.  "It didn't seem relevant," he said.  "Call it professionalism.  It doesn't change my duties, or my ability to execute them.  It doesn't present a conflict of interest.  So I didn't see a need to bring it up."
  "That's still kind of cold."
  "As you prefer."  They gave a shove together, sliding the bike's inert chassis along the shuttle floor to clear the lip of the ramp's opening.  James caught his breath, hands on his knees, brushing accumulated sand from his shirt.  "Coldness allows me to keep my head in a firefight, and improves my tactical aptitude.  It has kept me from losing a client many times over the years.  If it makes me less pleasant company, then that's just the cost that I need to pay."
  "Fair enough," James admitted.
  "Three more bikes to store," Raziel said, pointing his thumb back to the base's entrance.

  Before they knew it, the shuttle was packed and the team was prepared.  Chase gave the ship's computer several largely redundant scans, hoping to find any renegade tracking or surveillance software stashed in its core, but every scan returned with reassuring green lights.
  "It's not that I don't trust your thoroughness," she told Raziel.  "And it's not that I think we got the shuttle too easily.  I just feel like I'm going to overlook something glaringly obvious that gives us away, and they'll shoot us out of the sky before we ever land."
  Raziel suggested that they cut goodbyes short and leave as soon as possible to stem their nervous energy.  The others agreed with him.  The party performed a final check with the surveillance team for a clean exit path, braved the re-energized storm, and boarded their craft.  Raziel sat in the pilot's seat; Chase settled in to the co-pilot's.  As predicted, even stacked two by two, the hoverbikes occupied most of the rear compartment, but James and El made themselves as comfortable as they could in the remaining space.
  The shuttle lifted gently from the sandy soil at Raziel's touch on the control yoke.  The roaring wind outside howled louder than the engines as they passed the atmospheric layer of dark cloud.  As the shuttle crested the top of the clouds, the wind noise dropped and the instrument panel sprang into usefulness.  They rose smoothly to orbit, unchallenged and presumably unnoticed.  Chase began entering the coordinates of their destination: virtual star charts spun within her HUD.
  A sharp tug on the control yoke pulled the ship out of its stable orbit and careening wildly into the starlit sky.  James slid into a bulkhead and Chase cried out in surprise.
  "Interceptors," Raziel announced, his voice tense and controlled.  A pair of angular grey craft mirrored his maneuver.  Tiny bursts of light lit points along their pursuers' wings.  Chase realized belatedly that the other craft was firing on them and missing... so far.  "Punch in another destination, any destination."  She rapidly complied.
  Raziel eased on the interstellar drive.  A warning snap sounded throughout the shuttle's interior as one of the pursuing crafts' shots found its mark, just as the shuttle sprang ahead, stars blurring together into a rainbow cloak.
  Chase held her breath as they flew.  Realistically, the chances of her having charted them through the center of a star were impossibly remote.  It didn't stop her heart from pounding.
  After just a few minutes, he eased them back to a saner speed.  The stars faded into a blanket of distant, motionless pin pricks: they were deep in interstellar space, already lightyears from their point of origin.  Chase released her breath and somewhat more calmly resumed entering in their true destination.  There was a dizzying moment as the ship spun on three axes to reorient itself precisely, then another touch of the yoke sent them careening on their way.

  A digital display mounted above the open cockpit hatch steadily counted off the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until they reached their programmed destination.  El laughed at it.
  "It counts Earth time," he explained.  "Humans take their clocks with them wherever they go.  Even on Mintaka, twenty four hour days, three hundred sixty five and a quarter day years.  It's still in your blood, I think."
  "That may be," James said, contemplatively.  "I didn't know that we had interstellar flight until about a week ago, you recall."
  "That's right, I'm the first alien you've ever met, aren't I?"
  James nodded.  "Why do they keep all of this secret, anyway?" he asked, waving his hand to indicate the ship, and by extension the known universe.
  "Profit, I would expect," answered Chase.
  El agreed.  "An Earthbound corporation has a finite set of resources to draw from, finite real estate to build on.  An interstellar corporation has an incredible amount of raw materials to find.  Also, they can readily use massive amounts of slave labor without fear of PR reprecussions."  He pointed his thumb at his chest.  "So, profit."
  As predicted, they had several days to spend together before they would arrive in the Rigel system.  With Chase's help, Raziel had done some calculations and made microadjustments to their ship's pacing to arrive when Rigel III and its moon would be in a favorable orientation.  Then it was time to wait.  James graciously offered the use of his library to the others.  James passed most of his time reading and trying to keep his mind off of their destination.  Chase alternated restlessly between reading with him, talking with El, and sitting in the corner with her eyes shut, programming who knows what.  El and Raziel spent a fair amount of time playing match after match of chess, using a holographic set that Raziel provided.
  The shuttle had no sleeping quarters, so sleeping was awkward, but not overly uncomfortable.  James and Chase preferred to rest in the cargo bay in a gap that had been left along the bikes.  Raziel slept sitting in the pilot's chair, and El did his cross-legged meditative stance near the cabin hatch.
  All too soon, the countdown above the hatch reached hours, then minutes.  Raziel and Chase resumed their places in the cabin.  James joined them, out of an equal mix of nerves and curiosity.  Only El stayed in the shuttle's bay, his eyes half lidded.
