Guardian Angel

  The next day, while James was at work, Chase pulled data from the logs she'd recovered from the Intech files.  Optical video capture was not the ideal method to store large volumes of text.  She spent the morning crafting and debugging a program to automate the extraction of the raw data.  The afternoon was spent running it on her visual storage unit.  Her rushed handiwork was good enough to pull most of the data without intervention, but she had written the software to default to a manual query when its uncertainty passed a certain threshold.  Even the small percentage of particularly noisy frames that required her input occupied several hours.
  By the time James came home somewhat early that afternoon, she had the full log scanned and indexed.  She greeted him with a kiss and shared her view on a projected screen.  James settled beside her on the couch with a snack.  Together, they started to skim their way through the lengthy file, pausing frequently.  It was dense reading, full of ill-defined jargon and raw data.
  Early entries in the log seemed to be predominantly information gathering: coordinates and addresses for Alice's house, workplace, and regular haunts; fragmented transcripts of innocuous calls and messaging sessions; detailed biometric data, occasionally annotated with cryptic side notes.  James felt vaguely voyeuristic reading most of it, even second hand.  Chase showed no such reluctance, but then, this standard fare for her job.  Somebody had gone to tremendous lengths to catalog Alice's life with a frightening amount of detail.
  "Most of what we've seen so far is probably setting up the abduction," James observed.  "Is there anything that gives us a hint about why, or who?"
  "Well, it is just a log," Chase replied.  "I don't think we're likely to find answers to those questions here.  But it might give us a few new questions to ask."  She paged forward idly.  "For example: I see quite a lot of space devoted to her research at Kensington."  She flipped through a few pages of links to publications, brief bios on co-workers over the past few years, and references to surveillance captures at her workplace.  "Do you know what she did, exactly?"
  James thought back.  "I think her specialty was nanotech," he said.  "Medical nanotech.  Replacement hearts and other more complicated organs, things like that."
  Chase followed a few of the research links, more or less at random.  Sure enough, most of them had to do with techniques for growing and adapting organs, including lab studies for the same.  Based on her unscientific survey, it looked like Alice and her teams had met with mixed success.  Nanotech could indeed outperform vat-grown or donated organ transplantation some of the time.  The electronic equivalents had a limited capacity to adapt to the body's expectations and could do a very slightly better job at fooling the host's immune system into accepting it.  However, the more foreign materials and the sheer complexity of the system fought against their success, sometimes quite effectively.
  The next link was quite different.  "I didn't know she studied philosophy, too," James remarked.
  Chase was thoughtful for a moment.  "Would it be possible to build a replacement brain?" Chase asked.
  James shook his head.  "Nope.  Just about everything else, we can augment or replace if you've got the cash, but I've never heard of a brain replacement."
  "If I'm reading this right, that's just what Alice was thinking of doing," Chase observed.
  "Let's go back to the contact information," James suggested.  "Maybe we can find somebody to ask."
  Nodding, Chase flipped the document back to the appropriate bookmark.  Scanning through the text and cross-referencing with the Kensington directory, they were able to identify names of a half-dozen of Alice's peers, both current and former employees.  As Chase produced the names, James correlated them with sets of contact information from the Network directory.
  With the list complete, Chase resumed their skimming from the place they had left off.  "This looks like a record of the abduction itself," Chase said.  Her lips moved wordlessly as she scanned the timestamped records.  She highlighted a line.  "This must be the code for the virus they used to block everyone's optics.  Crafty.  Why would they stage the abduction in a crowded room?"
  James shrugged.  "The bystander effect?"  Chase gave him a questioning look.  "Oh, it's a well-known phenominon from crowd psychology.  If somebody gets robbed or breaks a leg or something in a crowd, people are actually less likely to help than if there are only a handful of people around.  Diffusion of social blame and all of that.  Everyone assumes that somebody else will help, so nobody does.  Maybe they couldn't get to her when she was alone, so they chose the most crowded point to take the most advantage of that, even if anyone happened to defeat the optic block."
  "I guess there weren't counting on you being there," Chase said with a smile.  "Huh," she said.  "There are two runs of the optic block listed here: one for Alice, I guess, and the other for the abductor.  I suppose that one got through Paranoiac somehow."  She gave a sheepish grin.  "Time to retrain the rules, I suppose."
  A few more pages flipped by.  "No name for the abductor," James pointed out.  "Just that NGL.  Looks like an internal designator."
  "Almost at the end of file," Chase announced.  "Hmm.  Nothing much after the abduction.  Just this PROCESSED line again.  That sounds ominous."
  James pulled up a chronometer on his HUD.  "Oh, right," he interjected.  "I promised to meet Spade tonight.  I should leave soon."
  Chase waved.  "Go ahead," she said.  "I think I've stared at this about as much as I can at once, anyway.  I'll secure it and get back to work at that cracking job from yesterday."

  The building that Spade had pointed out to him was an abandoned warehouse in the harbor district.  The harbor was a veritable gold mine for urban exploration.  It was an industrial district, sparsely populated after business hours, and filled with the detritus of a thousand failed manufacturing ventures.  Gaining access to the unclaimed property was often trivial, and determining what the previous owners had been trying to fabricate was a particularly entertaining challenge.

  James leaned against a wall at the side of the street and waiting for his friend, shivering.  Thick clouds transmuted the afternoon sun into a dim grey light.  A few minutes later, tentative flecks of snow began to fall.  You'd think that Spade's shock of green hair would be distinctive enough to stand out in a crowd.
  James' HUD flashed for his attention.  A message from Spade had just arrived.  [Delay on the red line,] it read.  [Go ahead without me, I'll catch up.]
  He complied, anxious to get inside before the wind picked up any more intensity.  Tonight's destination was found along a broad concrete street, wide enough to accomodate forklifts and other loading equipment.  Across the street was a cargo yard filled with a dull rainbow of carefully marked shipping containers.  Bright spotlights and a control tower of darkened steel kept vigilance on their valuable contents.  No such watch was kept on this ramshackle box of iron.  Small windows of darkened glass lined the otherwise featureless exterior walls.  The building's lower half was in relatively good repair, aside from the adornment of the occasional graffiti tag.  Its upper floors, however, were sagging and broken, visibly even from the outside.
  James ducked into an alley beside the building.  Sure enough, a small side door here was secured only by a half-rusted padlock.  A few strikes with a nearby concrete block shattered it with a bright spark.
  The interior of the warehouse was almost entirely occupied by a single room.  Heaps of metallic scraps, once painstakingly organized, were scattered across the cold concrete floor.  James could see the outline of some sort of crane underneath a tarp in the far corner, like a sleeping beast.  A small corner of the roof overhead had entirely collapsed: snow was already beginning to pile up in an irregular triangle against the walls.  Grey clouds overhead were cut by blackened girders.  A catwalk circled the room's perimeter; in the gloom, James could barely see clusters of what must be controls for equipment below.
  If his sense of direction was behaving correctly, the broken ceiling should overlook the Puget Sound and have quite a view.
  A ladder nearby looked to be in good repair.  He climbed it with agility, keeping a good grip on the cold metal.  The catwalk wasn't quite a sturdy as it had seemed from below, but despite the strained sound of protesting metal when he first put his weight on it, it still provided adequate support.  He slowly picked his way around the room's edge.  Once he reached the far corner, a broken support prevented further safe passage, but he found that he could just reach the girder overhead.  Bare light fixtures on chains, mostly empty, swung in unison along the girder's length as he pulled himself over and into a low crawl.  He inched his way along the beam.  The opening was only a few meters further.
  He emerged blinking into the opening under the grey sky and shifted himself into a sitting position around the beam.  Sure enough, he was well above the low, blocky buildings along the streets that sank to the Sound.  From his perch, he spent a minute watched cargo ships meander through the water, clusters of light lazily drifting across the water.
  "James Hawk," announced a voice behind him.
  James maintained enough presence of mind to keep his grip on the girder.  He turned slowly to face the speaker.  A sturdy man with an expressionless chiseled face, clad in black, stood effortlessly on the beam behind him.  "Who- ?"
  "I'm Raziel," the man introduced himself.  "I've been assigned to be your Guardian Angel."  Raziel extended a hand, formally.
  "What-"
  "Professional bodyguard," Raziel explained, patiently.  "The best that money can buy, as it happens."
  "Who hired you?"  Self-consciously, James attempted to come to his feet.  The beam was just wide enough for him to stand with one foot in front of the other.  He wobbled a little, caught himself, then gave up and lowered himself back to sitting.  Raziel's expression didn't change.
  "I don't know.  Company policy.  It could be awkward if we're protecting both sides of a vendetta, you understand."
  "I'm not sure that I really need a bodyguard..." James began.  As he spoke, Raziel reached into his overcoat and produced a long, thin object.  With a start, James recognized it as a sniper rifle.
  "This was trained on the front door of Ostrander's from noon until about one o'clock.  Its former owner was a professional killer.  It appears that a considerable amount of wealth wants you dead, and a different considerable amount of wealth wants you alive.  If I were you, I know which side I'd be on."
  "Let me rephrase," James said carefully, keeping his eyes on the rifle.  "How can I be sure that you won't get a higher bid to have me dead tomorrow?"
  "It's in the contract," Raziel said matter-of-factly.  "It's not good business to turn on your clients halfway through the contract."  He got a distance look in his eye for a moment, presumably checking something on his HUD.  "Chase Duvier is included in my charge, as well.  We should get back to her as soon as possible."
  James considered his meeting with Spade, then remembered the sniper rifle.  It's one thing to think that the world is out to get you, and quite another to see the weapons they were out to get you with.  Of course he had no guarantee that Raziel was telling the truth.  At this height, offing him wouldn't even take the rifle, just a few pounds of force in a shove, and Raziel had ample opportunity to deliver it.  Oh well.
  [Spade, I'm out for tonight,] he messaged.  [Something came up.]  "Okay, let's go," he said out loud.
  Raziel nodded, then stepped off the edge.  He landed silently in a crouch far below on the warehouse floor.  Combat augs, James thought, picking his way carefully back around the room and down the ladder.  Raziel waited stoically as he dusted himself off.  Together they exited the warehouse.

  "Wow, we rate an Angel?" Chase said after James had performed introductions.  She seemed much less intimidated than James had been, although her cheeks still paled noticeably when Raziel showed her the rifle.
  "Pleased to make your acquiantance," Raziel said, shaking her hand.  "If I could make a suggestion."
  "Please," said Chase.
  "You should relocate living spaces immediately.  I have a number of safe houses you may find satisfactory, but this place is almost certainly a mortal danger for you both."

  A board meeting was commencing around a lavish table.  A dozen humorless men in suits entered the room and found their habitual seats.
  "Let's bring this meeting to order," suggested a younger man sitting at the table's head.  "Do you all have copies of the agenda?"  He cast his gaze around the assembled group, seeing a chorus of nods.
  "First item," he intoned.  "This month's Pandora alerts.  Charles?"
  A balding man halfway down the table cleared his throat.  "It's been a busy month for us," he began in a gruff voice.  "Four individuals provoked alerts, two in this past week."  As he spoke, a presenter stirred to life within the table's polished ebony surface; a set of faces, profile and direct, flashed past.  "Acquisition proceded smoothly in all cases.  All four subjects have been collected successfully and turned over to Terrence's department."  Terrence gave a solemn nod of confirmation from across the table.
  "Excellent news.  Gregory?  Any incidents to speak of?"
  Gregory had piercing eyes set in a face like a hatchet.  Something in his posture and his bearing set off subconsious warning bells in those who looked at him.  Even in formal wear, his stance screamed "killer."  "'Smoothly' may be an overstatement," Gregory said, in an unexpectedly soft voice. The man called Charles winced visibly.  "After our third acquisition, routine post-operation watchlisting discovered two individuals performing suspect queries on the network.  One was a bystander at the acquisition point who should have been screened and wiped."  A familiar face, captured by a monorail security camera, flashed on the screen.  Gregory cast a meaningful glance at another man around the table.  "The other was this man.  We're not certain yet what prompted him to search for the subject, as he does not appear to have any relationship with the first."  A hapless middle-aged businessman appeared on the screen.  "The second individual has been successfully eliminated, through the usual channels.  The first was to be dealt with today, but our subcontractor never reported back.  We'll be reassigning that job shortly."
  "There was the break-in last night, too," prompted the facilities manager.
  "Yes, I was getting to that," Gregory said calmly.  "Unidentified individuals apparently entered the Paradise data warehouse, tripping the security perimeter around midnight last night.  Security troops dispatched to the location were unable to find traces of any trespassers at the site.  The terminal showed records of an access attempt, but no successful breach occurred."
  "Other than that, no incidents to report.  It's been a quiet month for us."
  The man at the head of the table smiled slightly.
  "Good enough.  Gregory, be sure to inform us when the second leak has been quelched."  Gregory made an internal note to do so.  "Next item: budget."
